    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project inplements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to recommend underground music based on user preferences. The system uses a combination of techniques to provide semantically rich and contextually aware music recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline begins with data preparation. A CSV dataset was created containing album information that was scraped from bandcamp.com. The CSV is then processed by an embedding model to generate dense vector embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of each album. These embeddings and the original data are then stored in a Hugging Face Datasets format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity search is achieved by indexing the embeddigns with FAISS. This allows for rapid retrieval of the most relevant albums based on the user's query. Then those albums are reranked based on a calculated score value before being passed into the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the relevant documents are received the user's prompt as well as the document data are all given to the LLM which is what the user is directly interacting with."
